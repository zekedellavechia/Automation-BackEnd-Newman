# Automated Back End HTML reports using Newman

HTML reports are a great way to show to the rest of the team the results of our current test execution. 

They are clear and they contain the results written in a way that everybody who accesses this file can see the information and have no doubts about it. 

Also, it gives a professional touch. There's no comparison between a word document and an HTML!

Please check my youtube channel for more info.
